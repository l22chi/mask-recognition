# The CNN classifier model

At the beginning of the project, there was to be only this model. It was a model explained by Phd Sarah Guthals during an article dealing with the classification of space rocks using Python and artificial intelligence (in partnership with Microsoft's learning modules). It is made from the PyTorch library (more precisely the torch and torchvision modules). It aims to create and train a classic neural network for image classification according to n classes. I adapted it to my project so that it could classify and recognize the images where I wear a mask and those where I don't.
